        <p>Hi, I'm Joe.</p>
        <p>
          I'm a full-stack web developer with knowledge of various programming
          languages which are: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C, and C++. I also have
          expertise in different frameworks and libraries such as Bootstrap,
          Next.js, React.js, and Express.js. Considering databases, I also have
          a fundamental knowledge of MongoDB and SQL.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm a full-time student, currently studying at Seneca College School
          of Software Design &amp; Data Science. My focus is to be good at web
          development, so that when I graduate I'll have the skills I needed to
          get hired as a web developer. I'm hoping to graduate in the year 2024
          of the month September.
        </p>
